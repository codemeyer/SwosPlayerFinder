# SWOS Player Finder

Sensible World of Soccer is one of my all-time favorite games. Despite being released more than 20 years ago, it still beats most modern games when it comes to playability.


## Player skills

In Sensible World of Soccer, a player has seven different skills. Each skill goes from 1 to 8, where 1 is worst and 8 is best.

The different skills are:

* [P] Passing
* [S] Speed
* [H] Heading
* [T] Tackling
* [C] Control
* [V] Shooting
* [F] Finishing (Shot power inside the box)

The total sum of the player's skill points determines the value/cost of the player. As such, there are no actual "bargain" players - however, some skills are less important for some positions. For example, if you want a quick forward with great shooting skills but who won't bankrupt you, it might be wise to look for someone with a low skill in tackling, heading or passing to drive the price down.

For instance, Valdas Ivanauskas of Hamburg has 8 in Shooting and Finishing, and 7 in Speed. But since he only has 2 in Passing, 3 in Heading and Tackling and 4 in Control, his price goes down considerably, landing at just 1M.


## So what does SWOS Player Finder let you do?

This Windows app lets you load player data for a SWOS installation, and filter the data for players with specific skill sets.

It is quite simple to set up a filter for a player costing below a certain amount, but who has high skill points in areas that are relevant for the position you are looking for.
