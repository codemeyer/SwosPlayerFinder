# SWOS Player Finder

Sensible World of Soccer is one of my all-time favorite games. Despite being released more than 20 years ago, it still beats most modern games when it comes to playability.

This Windows app lets you load player data for a SWOS installation, and filter the data for "bargain" players. (as soon as I get 1M, I always go for Valdas Ivanauskas of Hamburg)
